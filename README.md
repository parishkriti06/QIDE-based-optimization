# QIDE-based-optimization

-->In this project, I tackled the challenge of optimizing a complex fitness function using Quantum-Inspired Differential Evolution (QIDE)—a cutting-edge algorithm inspired by quantum principles. The objective was to minimize a nonlinear fitness function, Z, dependent on modulation index, voltage parameters, and trigonometric relationships of decision variables a1 and a2.

--> I implemented QIDE in MATLAB, leveraging its ability to efficiently navigate high-dimensional search spaces and handle constraints. The algorithm explored multiple solutions simultaneously, overcoming challenges such as symmetry between variables and discovering four distinct solutions. Interestingly, depending on parameter settings, the function converged to near-zero values (as small as ~10^-55), showcasing the algorithm’s precision.

--> Through this project, I demonstrated the potential of quantum-inspired techniques for solving real-world optimization problems, providing valuable insights into convergence behavior and system dynamics.
